This Codebook describes the variables, data, and transformations 
used to arrive at the resulting data set in the project.

The resulting data includes the following variables:
* The activity name
* The subject number
* The varible measured
* The average measurement of the variable

There are 2,310 observations in the resulting data set

A few steps were taken to reach this point:
1. The training and test raw data were combined into one table
2. The raw data was labeled with the names of the features being measured from the 
features.txt file
3. The data was then filtered down to only the mean and standard deviation measures
4. The activity labels were changed from numbers to the actual activity names
taken from the activity_labels.txt file
5. This resulting data is then melted to make it tidy
6. the measurements are then averaged for each subject and activity
